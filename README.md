SIMPLE BANKING SYSTEM

The name of my project is Simple banking system. In this project I have used two classes Bank and Bank account. In Bank account I have used different
variables like name, account type, account number, balance, amount to be deposited and mobile number. A parameterised constructed is also used here
to initialize variables. Here five methods are used. Create_account is used to create a new account. Deposit method is used to add money to your 
account. Withdraw method is used to withdraw money from your account. Display method is used to display all the details regarding the account.
Display_balance is used to return the balance amount in your account. The next class is Bank where I have given he main method and an object of Bank
account is created. When calling the methods with object all the details will be displayed.
